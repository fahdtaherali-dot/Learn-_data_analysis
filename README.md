# 📊 Data Analysis Learning Journey

This repository showcases my progress in learning **Data Analysis** and **Relational Databases (SQL)**. It contains structured scripts for database creation and management.

## 🗂️ Project Overview
The `data.sql` file demonstrates fundamental SQL skills, including:
* **Schema Design:** Designing structured tables for entities like Products and Customers.
* **Data Integrity:** Implementation of `PRIMARY KEY` and `AUTO_INCREMENT` constraints.
* **Data Population:** Efficiently inserting and managing sample records.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** SQL
* **Environment:** MySQL / MariaDB (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or copy the content of `data.sql`.
2. Import the script into your SQL environment.
3. The database schema and sample data will be created automatically.
